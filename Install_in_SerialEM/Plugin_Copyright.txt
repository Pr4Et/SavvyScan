SerialEM uses TIFF libraries which are Copyright (c) 1988-1997 Sam Leffler
and Copyright (c) 1991-1997 Silicon Graphics, Inc.

Because SerialEM uses the libjpeg library, this software is based in part on
the work of the Independent JPEG Group.  SerialEM also uses the zlib library,
which is Copyright (c) 1995-2010 by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler.

SerialEM uses the libcfshr and libiimod libraries from IMOD, which are covered
by the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), a copy of which is in
LGPL.txt.  SerialEM also includes the Mini-XML library from IMOD,
which is Copyright 2003-2016 by Michael R. Sweet and is covered by the
modified Library GPL in Mini-XML.txt.

32-bit SerialEM uses FFTW libraries under a purchased license; those are
Copyright (c) 1997--1999 Massachusetts Institute of Technology, written by
Matteo Frigo and Steven G. Johnson.  64-bit SerialEM uses an early derivative
of the FFT library included in IMOD, which is also covered by the LGPL.

SerialEM also uses a Set dialog DPI helper class, Copyright (C) 2003 by George
Yohng, and XFolderDialog by Hans Dietrich.
